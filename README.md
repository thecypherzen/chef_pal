## Overview

**ChefPal** is a simple todo demo application built with `react`. It helps users to get recipes of verious foods so they can be their own chef, their own way. Each recipe comes with useful information like **estimation of cost, ingredients, cooking instructions, and more.*

It holds not many features, but promises to be improved upon as time goes on, consolidating on knowledge growth in React, Javascript and other technologies, as the case may be.

Data is persited to browser local storage at the beginning, pending when the database persistence would be rolled out.
